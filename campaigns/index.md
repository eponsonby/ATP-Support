A campaign is a project, resource, or organizational structure that can be used to collect, track, and organize job seekers of interest in ATP. It has the flexibility to represent anything you need it to. Some examples of ways campaigns can be used are:

- a collection of job seekers to call by a certain date
- a collection of job seekers of a certain profession
- a collection of job seekers in a certain location
- a collection of job seekers you want your co-worker to reach out to
