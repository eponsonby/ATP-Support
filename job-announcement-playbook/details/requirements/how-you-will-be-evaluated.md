This section describes how you will evaluate an applicant and their application.  The content needs to set the expectation of how you’ll evaluate an applicant against their responses to the job questionnaire and the information in their resume.

This section will:

*	Include a lead-in sentence: "You will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above."

### Basis for rating

The basis for rating is the method you will use to evaluate an applicant.  It's important to describe how you will evaluate an applicant.

The method of rating may include one or more of the following:

*	Resume
*	Answers to the online job questionnaire
*	Work samples (writing samples, project related samples, design work etc.)
*	An assessment (a written test, project related assessment, etc) - sometimes this is called a simulation.
*	Interview

Details on [rating procedures can be found in the DEO Handbook](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf).

### Consideration order

This tells the applicant which groups of people you will consider first, based on eligibility. This section is not required and OPM Policy does not consider it necessary to expose this part of the process to applicants. Thus you may remove this information from your job announcements.

### Drug test required

The DEO handbook does require to indicate under Basis for Rating whether a drug test is required. We've moved that information under [Background check and security clearance](../background-check/#drug-test-required) to give it a permanent home alongside the other checks and clearances an applicant will need to undergo.

### Financial suitability

A link to the financial suitability guidance is now found in the [Fair and Transparent - Legal and regulatory guidance](../../fair-and-transparent/#legal-and-regulatory-guidance) section.
