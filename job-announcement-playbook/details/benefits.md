### Agency benefits

This text allows the agency to describe benefits that they offer above and beyond the standard Federal government benefits. If your agency has it’s own benefits page, you can add a link to that page.

  * May add a link to an agency-specific benefits or career page, but make sure the link label accurately describes the page.  
    * For example, if you only have a benefits page, the label should say “Learn more about our benefits”.  If you have a benefits and career page together, use “Learn more about our benefits and careers.”
</div>
<div class="usajobs-recruitment-joa-playbook-details__do-not">
  <h4><span class="fa fa-times"></span> Do Not</h4>
  * Do not repeat benefits information in any other section — it should only appear in the benefits section.
